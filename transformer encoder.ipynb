Organization\\n\\nAUO Corporation (\\u201cAUO\\u201d, formerly AU Optronics Corp.) was founded on August 12, 1996 and is located in Hsinchu Science Park, the Republic of China (\\u201c ROC\\u201d ). AUO\\u2019 s main activities are the research, development, production and sale of thin film transistor liquid crystal displays (\\u201cTFT-LCDs\\u201d) and other flat panel displays used in a wide variety of applications. AUO also engages in the production and sale of solar modules and systems. AUO\\u2019 s common shares have been publicly listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange since September 2000, and its American Depositary Shares (\\u201cADSs\\u201d) have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\\u201cNYSE\\u201d) since May 2002. On and from October 1, 2019, AUO\\u2019s ADSs has delisted from the NYSE and begun trading on the over-the-counter (\\u201cOTC\\u201d) market. Further on January 27, 2021, AUO\\u2019s ADSs and underlying ordinary shares was officially cancelled from the registration of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and its reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act was terminated.\\n\\nOn September 1, 2001, October 1, 2006 and October 1, 2016, Unipac Optoelectronics Corp.

AUO is the surviving Company, whereas Unipac, QDI and CFI were dissolved.\\n\\nIn order to advance AUO\\u2019 s value transformation strategy, to accelerate the extension of the value chain and enhance the overall operating performance, upon the resolution of the shareholders\\u2019 meeting held on June 17, 2020, AUO demerged and transferred the business of the General Display and the Public Information Display, including assets, liabilities and the operations, to its wholly-owned subsidiary, AUO Display Plus Corporation (\\u201cADP\\u201d). ADP issued new shares to AUO as the consideration. The effective date of the demerger was set on January 1, 2021.\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise AUO and its subsidiaries (collectively as \\u201cthe Company\\u201d).\"\n",

When a company has no deficit, such capital surplus may be distributed by issuing common stock as stock dividends or by cash according to the proportion of shareholdings. In accordance with AUO\\u2019 s Articles of Incorporation, cash distribution from capital surplus should be approved by AUO\\u2019s Board of Directors and reported to AUO\\u2019s shareholders in its meeting. Pursuant to the ROC Regulations Governing the Offering and Issuance of Securities by Securities Issuers, the total sum of capital surplus capitalized per annum shall not exceed 10 percent of the paid-in capital.\\n\\nRetained earnings and dividend policy\\n\\nIn accordance with AUO\\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by AUO\\u2019 s Board of Directors and reported to AUO\\u2019 s shareholders in its meeting. After payment of income taxes and offsetting accumulated deficits, the legal reserve shall be set aside until the accumulated legal reserve equals AUO\\u2019s paid-in capital. In addition, a special reserve in accordance with applicable laws and regulations shall also be set aside or reversed. The remaining current-year earnings together with accumulated undistributed earnings from preceding years can be distributed according to relevant laws and AUO\\u2019s Articles of Incorporation.\\n\\nLegal reserve may be used to offset a deficit. When the Company incurs no loss, it may distribute its legal reserve by issuing new shares or by cash in accordance with the proportion of shareholdings for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital.\\n\\n(Continued)\\n\\n30\\n\\nAUO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nAUO\\u2019 s dividend policy is to pay dividends from surplus considering factors such as AUO\\u2019 s current and future investment environment, cash requirements, domestic and overseas competitive conditions and capital budget requirements, while into account shareholders\\u2019 interest, maintenance of balanced dividend and AUO\\u2019s long-term financial plan. If the current-year retained earnings available for distribution reach 2% of the paid-in capital of AUO, dividend to be distributed shall be no less than 20% of the current-year retained earnings available for distribution. If the current-year retained earnings available for distribution do not reach 2% of the paid-in capital of AUO, AUO may decide not to distribute dividend. The cash portion of the dividend, which may be in the form of cash and stock, shall not be less than 10% of the year. The dividend distribution ratio aforementioned could be adjusted after taking into consideration factors such as finance, business and operations, etc.\\n\\nPursuant to relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the local authority, total net debit balance of the other components of equity shall be set aside from current earnings as special reserve, and not for distribution. Subsequent decrease pertaining to items that are accounted for as a reduction to the other components of equity shall be reclassified from special reserve to undistributed earnings.\\n\\nOn February 23, 2023, AUO\\u2019 s Board of Directors resolved not to distribute dividends for 2022. On May 26, 2023, the annual shareholders\\u2019 meeting resolved the distribution of other earnings for 2022, comprising a reversal of special reserve of $1,122,876 thousand and no dividend distribution.

Additionally, in the first quarter of 2021, AUO entered into long-term sales agreements with customers and has received payments in advance. AUO accounted for such obligation as contract liabilities.\\n\\n(21) Remuneration to Employees and Directors\\n\\nAccording to AUO\\u2019 s Articles of Incorporation, AUO should distribute remuneration to employees and directors no less than 5% and no more than 1% of annual profits before income tax, respectively, after offsetting accumulated deficits, if any. Only employees, including employees of affiliate companies that meet certain conditions are entitled to the abovementioned remuneration which to be distributed in stock or cash. The said conditions and distribution method are decided by Board of Directors or the personnel authorized by Board of Directors.\\n\\nAUO did not accrue remuneration to employees and directors due to the loss making position for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. AUO accrued remuneration to employees based on the profit before income tax excluding the remuneration to employees and directors for the period, multiplied by the percentage resolved by Board of Directors. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, AUO made a reversal of $388,792 thousand and an estimation of $183,107 thousand, respectively, on the remuneration to employees. Remuneration to directors was estimated based on the amount expected to pay and recognized together with the remuneration to employees as cost of sales or operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is determined by dividing the amount of remuneration by the closing price of the shares (ignoring ex-dividend effect) on the day preceding the Board of Directors\\u2019 meeting. If there is a change in the proposed amounts after the annual consolidated financial statements are authorized for issue, the differences are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and adjusted prospectively to next year\\u2019s profit or loss.\\n\\nRemuneration to employees and directors for 2021 in the amounts of $6,339,435 thousand and $206,946 thousand, respectively, in cash for payment had been approved in the meeting of Board of Directors held on March 28, 2022. The aforementioned approved amounts are the same as the amounts charged against earnings of 2021.\\n\\nThe information about AUO\\u2019 s remuneration to employees and directors is available at the Market Observation Post System website.\\n\\n(Continued)\\n\\n37\"\n",

AUO does not believe service has been properly made, but in order to protect its rights, AUO has retained counsel to handle the related matter, and at this stage, the final outcome of these matters is uncertain. AUO has been reviewing the merits of this lawsuit on an on-going basis.\\n\\nIn September 2018, AUOUS received a complaint filed by the Government of Puerto Rico on its own behalf and on behalf of all consumers and governmental agencies of Puerto Rico against certain LCD manufacturers including AUO and AUOUS in the Superior Court of San Juan, Court of First Instance alleging unjust enrichment and claiming unspecified monetary damages. AUO has retained counsel to handle the related matter and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously. In October 2022, the Superior Court of San Juan, Court of First Instance entered a judgment dismissing the case.\\n\\nAs of July 26, 2023, the Company has made certain provisions with respect to certain of the above lawsuits as the management deems appropriate, considering factors such as the nature of the litigation or claims, the materiality of the amount of possible loss, the progress of the cases and the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors. Management will reassess all litigation and claims at each reporting date based on the facts and circumstances that exist at that time, and will make additional provisions or adjustments to previous provisions. The ultimate amount cannot be ascertained until the relevant cases are closed. The ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings and/or lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty. While management intends to defend certain of the lawsuits described above vigorously, there is a possibility that one or more legal proceedings or lawsuits may result in an unfavorable outcome to the Company. In addition to the matters described above, the Company is also a party to other litigations or proceedings that arise during the ordinary course of business. Except as mentioned above, the Company, to its knowledge, is not involved as a defendant in any material litigation or proceeding which could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business or results of operations.\"\n",
